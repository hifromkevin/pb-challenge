# Pottery Barn Coding Challenge

## Directions:
 - Display a fully responsive grid of products from the attached json file (image, name, price)
 - User clicks product to store the product in local storage
 - Stored products are persistent and rendered (from local storage) in another section (either same page or different page)
 - User can click stored products to remove them from local storage
 - We'll be testing persistence by closing the browser and reloading the page
 - As much as possible, stick to vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation (queries, events, etc.)

## Requirements:
 - Node (Tested using Node v11.13.0, but any modern version should work)

## To Begin: 
 - Locate the root folder with your terminal
 - Enter 'npm install' for dependencies
 - Enter 'npm start' to render application to http://localhost:3005/ (inspired by the Childish Gambino song '3005')

## Using the App:
 - Click on the desired product(s)
 - Go to http://localhost:3005/saved.html to view the list of selected product(s)
 - Click on a saved product to remove it from the list of saved products
